# Example User

This is a simple Joomla component on which an administrator can choose any user in the backend. The chosen user will 
then be displayed in the frontend.

# Usage

## Build project

To build the component, either run the build.bat or build.sh script (depending on your OS). You will find a 
ready-to-install `com_exampleuser.zip` file in the `/dist` folder of your cloned repository. You can install it in the 
backend of your Joomla installation.
